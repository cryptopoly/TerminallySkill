## What is TerminallySKILL?

TerminallySKILL is a **free, open-source desktop app** that replaces your scattered terminal windows, SSH clients, and CLI cheat-sheets with a single, powerful workspace.

### The Problem

- 🤯 **CLI fatigue** — memorising flags, syntax, and argument order for dozens of tools
- 🔄 **Context switching** — juggling terminals, SSH sessions, and scripts across windows
- 📝 **Lost knowledge** — that perfect one-liner from last month? Gone forever
- 🎯 **No visibility** — scripts run, things break, and you're left scrolling through walls of text

### The Solution

- ✅ **Visual command builder** — every CLI tool on your system, presented as a form
- ✅ **Workflow scripts** — multi-step automation with retries, approvals, and variable substitution
- ✅ **Reusable snippets** — save commands with `{{placeholders}}` for repeated use
- ✅ **AI-powered review** — safety checks, explanations, and natural-language command drafting
- ✅ **SSH + encrypted VNC** — remote terminals and full graphical desktops through SSH tunnels
- ✅ **Clipboard paste into VNC** — Ctrl+V pastes directly into remote desktops
- ✅ **Windows support (beta)** — PowerShell integration, command detection, and script execution — work in progress
- ✅ **Local-first** — your data stays on your machine, always

## 🎯 Features

### 🔧 Visual Command Builder
Every CLI tool on your system PATH is auto-discovered and presented as a form-based builder. Select flags, fill arguments, and watch the live command preview update — no syntax memorisation required. Edit the final command directly before copying or executing.

### 📜 Workflow Scripts
Build multi-step automation scripts with commands, approval checkpoints, and notes. Inputs use `{{placeholder}}` substitution so the same script runs with different values. Export as `.tvflow` files to share with your team. Each step supports retry logic and continue-on-error control.

### ✂️ Snippets
Save reusable command templates with `{{placeholder}}` variables. Open a snippet, fill in the fields, and run — ideal for commands you use often with changing parameters.

### 💻 Terminal
Full shell sessions powered by node-pty and xterm.js:
- **Editor Prompt** — command bar with ghost suggestions, history cycling, and safe paste handling
- **Split panes** — vertical or horizontal splits with independent sessions
- **Command queue** — type while a command is running; input fires when the shell is ready
- **Output snapshots** — capture terminal output and compare any two with side-by-side diff
- **In-terminal search** — regex, case-sensitive, and whole-word matching
- **PATH fix** — detects missing commands and offers one-click binary location + shell config update

### 🌐 SSH & Remote Access
Projects can target remote SSH hosts as naturally as local directories. Configure host, user, port, and identity file — then every terminal session, script run, and workflow step executes on the remote machine transparently.

- **SSH key setup helper** — built-in guide for `ssh-keygen` + `ssh-copy-id`
- **Interactive SSH shell** — raw TTY shell on the remote host in a dedicated tab
- **Encrypted VNC remote desktop** — stream the remote graphical desktop through an SSH tunnel. No extra firewall rules — only port 22 needed
- **Clipboard integration** — Ctrl+V pastes into VNC sessions; clipboard syncs both directions

### 🤖 AI-Powered Tools
Bring your own API keys for any major provider, or run completely offline with a local model:
- **Command Review** — safety and syntax analysis before you run, with conversational follow-up
- **Command Explain** — plain-language breakdown of any command and its flags
- **AI Draft** — describe what you want in natural language; AI populates the command builder
- **Output Review** — send terminal output or saved logs to AI for analysis
- **Selection Review** — right-click any selected text in the terminal or logs for instant review

**Supported providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, Mistral, xAI (Grok), DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Together.ai, Fireworks.ai, Ollama, LM Studio, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

### 📁 Projects
Organise work into named projects with their own working directory (local or SSH), environment variables, favourite commands, terminal sessions, and colour badge for instant visual identification.

### 📊 Runs & Logs
- **Unified log browser** — workflow runs and terminal logs in a single time-ordered list
- **Structured run history** — step timings, status, retry counts, and linked terminal logs
- **Full-text log search** — search across all saved output with match highlighting
- **Run comparison** — diff consecutive runs to catch regressions or confirm fixes
- **AI review from logs** — send selected text directly to AI Review

### 📂 File Browser
Browse your project directory with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and a code-editor layout for any file type. Open files directly in the terminal or send to AI for review.

### 🎨 Themes
Eight built-in themes:

| Dark | Light |
|------|-------|
| Void (teal) | Chalk (cream) |
| Ember (amber) | Latte (espresso) |
| Dusk (indigo) | Sage (olive) |
| Forest (green) | Mist (cool paper) |

### ⚙️ Settings & Customisation
- AI provider configuration with live connection testing and fallback routing
- Terminal input mode: Classic shell or Editor Prompt
- Safe paste mode — confirmation dialog before executing multi-line pastes
- Configurable log storage directory with per-project overrides
- Rich help tooltips (togglable) with descriptions and keyboard shortcuts
- Command palette (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) for instant access to any action
- Auto-update with configurable channel

### Run in Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the Electron app with hot module replacement. Main process changes require a restart.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Compiles into `out/`. Useful for checking TypeScript/build errors.

### Package (Create Installers)

```bash
# macOS
npm run package:mac          # Universal (x64 + arm64)
npm run package:mac:x64      # Intel only
npm run package:mac:arm64    # Apple Silicon only

# Linux
npm run package:linux        # AppImage + .deb (x64 and arm64)
npm run package:linux:x64
